## Key Points

Question:  What is the association of male gender expressivity (MGE) – a measure reflecting sociocultural pressures around masculinity – with awareness and treatment of modifiable cardiovascular disease risks?

Findings: This cohort study involving 4,230 male participants found elevations in adolescent MGE were significantly associated with an 11% lower probability of adult hypertension treatment and a 15% lower probability of adult diabetes awareness. Elevations in young adult MGE were associated with lower probabilities of adult hypertension awareness, hypertension treatment, and diabetes treatment. 
 
Meaning:  Sociocultural pressures to perform masculinity may lead to worse cardiovascular disease outcomes through associations with decreased awareness and treatment of modifiable risks.

## Project Reproducibility with `renv`

This project utilizes `renv` for R dependency management to ensure reproducibility. `renv` captures the exact versions of R packages used, enabling consistent execution of scripts across different environments.

### Execution
Execute `source("run_all.R")` to run the analyses. Outputs are generated in the `outputs` directory.
