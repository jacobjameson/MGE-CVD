Background: Traditional male gender expressivity (MGE), which quantifies the impact of sociocultural pressures around masculinity, has been associated with adverse health outcomes. Yet little is known about associations of MGE with cardiovascular disease (CVD). 

Objective: To investigate associations of MGE with individual-level CVD risk awareness and treatment in men.

Design: Nationally-representative, longitudinal cohort study.

Participants:  Male adolescents (aged 12-18; 1994-1995) were followed longitudinally through young adulthood (24-32; 2008-2009) and adulthood (33-43; 2016-2018).
Main measures: MGE was assessed in adolescence and young adulthood using a validated measurement technique. CVD risk awareness was assessed in adults by self-reported diagnoses of hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia among participants with elevated blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, or non-HDL cholesterol, respectively. Treatment was measured by self-reported antihypertensive, hypoglycemic, or lipid-lowering medication use among participants reporting hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipemia, respectively. Multivariable regression was used to model associations of adolescent and young adult MGE with adult CVD risk awareness and treatment. Marginal effects ($dy/dx$) were calculated to obtain predicted probabilities.

Key Results: Among 4,230 eligible participants, higher adolescent MGE was not associated with hypertension awareness ($dy/dx=-0.02, p=0.21$), but young adult MGE was ($dy/dx=-0.04, p=0.02$). By contrast, higher adolescent ($dy/dx=-0.15, p=0.02$), but not young adult ($dy/dx=-0.06, p=0.30$) MGE was associated with lower diabetes awareness. Neither adolescent nor young adult MGE was associated with hyperlipidemia awareness. In adult men who reported hypertension diagnoses, higher adolescent ($dy/dx =-0.11, p< 0.01$) and young adult (dy/dx =-0.07, p=0.01) MGE were associated with lower hypertension treatment. In adult men who reported diabetes, adolescent MGE was not associated with diabetes treatment (dy/dx=-0.05, p= 0.45), but young adult MGE was ($dy/dx =-0.10, p=0.04$). MGE was not associated with hyperlipidemia treatment. 

Conclusions: Higher MGE among adolescent and young adult men predicted lower adult hypertension and diabetes awareness and treatment. MGE may be an overlooked factor influencing CVD outcomes.
